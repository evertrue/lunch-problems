# Coin Weighing/Find the Counterfeit Coin
_Asked 10/21/2014_

You have 12 coins and a balance scale. One of the coins is a counterfeit coin, which in this case means that it has a different weight (either heavier or lighter) than the other 11 coins (which all have a uniform weight). You are challenged to determine which of the coins is counterfeit AND whether it is heavier than or lighter than the other 11 coins. You can weigh any grouping of coins against each other for each weighing and keep track of information between weighings. Remember that this is a balance scale, meaning you can only tell whether the weight of one side is heavier, lighter, or equal to the weight of the other side.
