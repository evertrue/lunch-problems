# Fuses
_Asked: 11/5/2014_

You are locked in a room. To get out you must hit two buzzers; the second exactly 45 minutes after the first. You are given a lighter and two identical fuzes. The fuses burn from one end to the other in exactly 1 hour, but do not burn consistently (i.e. the fuse will not necessairly burn 1/6 of the way in 10 minutes). How do you measure out 45 minutes with the given materials in order to escape?
