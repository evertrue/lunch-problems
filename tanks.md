# Tanks
## Asked 11/6/2014

You are at war and have just captured 2 enemy tanks. Both tanks are identical. You've been tasked to figure out what is the minimum number of blocks needed to distroy a tank. If you use the threshold number or more the tank will be completely destroyed. If you use anything less, the tank will be completely unscathed. You already know that 100 blocks will destroy the thanks. You have an infinite number of blocks at your disposal but each test will compromise your position. What is the minimum number of tests needed to determine the minimum number of blocks necessary destroy the tanks?
